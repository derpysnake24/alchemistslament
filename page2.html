        <h1> Wilkommen: </h1>
	<p>
 		Numeber 2, I am off and running. Something along the lines of "a man is his habits". With a quick duckduckgo I have discovered how to not only create 
		another page for my website, but LINK that page on the previous one. My next step will probably be learning
		how to italicize parts of a paragraph instead of relying on capitalization. But I'm only doing this to write in HTML, not about it. I want to talk about labor unions. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I made a trip to Boston meet with a union and learn about their salt program. It has a wikipedia page so feel free to look it up, but essentially I would be secretly working for the 
		union (without pay) in a hotel as a dishwasher, where I would attempt to unionize the labor force at the hotel. My friend who does something similar in DC got me in contact with them, and I
		was certainly intrigued. I could make a real, positive material impact on people's lives and join a group of like-minded people who have similar feelings about the world we live in today. 
		On top of that I would learn how to effectively organize a group of people into a cohesive movement that fights for respect and positive change in their lives.  
		But honestly that's where the advantage's end. I would be working a minimum wage, manual labor job without benefits for 40/hrs a week, on top of my duties to the union. And if I did end up winning 
		benefits with a union, I would probably lose them since the union would send me to another location to unionize them. Thankfully I still have most of my insurance through my parents, but that
		can't last forever. If I didn't end up liking the path I took, I could very easily leave, and only be left with a glaring gap on my resume, cause there's no way in hell I could get a 
		job if I put "union salt" on my resume.

		Seeing the forest for the trees doesn't help much either. Who's to say if helping build the union is even a worthwhile pursuit to stopping capitalism? Frankly the only way I've seen a society
		transition away from capitalism successfully was through revolution (disregarding where they ended up), not that one is around the corner though. Unions are still limited by laws and politics,
		and have to make concessions to capitalists to get ahead. They still need to pay all their employees and, in a sense, turn a profit. A union cannot exist without a corporation. They don't seem
		to be building anything new, rather just kind of making the existing system slightly less bad. I was struck by this most explicitly when one of the union leaders, giving a speech to members, 
		derided the hotel management for cutting people's hours, with the workers seemingly agreeing that they need to be working their asses off more not less. I understand the argument about needing more
		money to live a decent life, but I always viewed socialism as a way to give people more free time, not less. They also can't get managers to join the union, which make the problem of pushing the 
		union all the way up to the owners of a company nigh impossible. I get that the workers are still the backbone of any business but they will just go through boss after boss, and have to continually
		remind them of the place of the union in their workplace.
	</p>

		This highlights the sisyphean nature of the task itself. Leftist movements in general are like this, but unions strike me as especially so. It is a constant fight for the freedom from want against
		the most powerful people in modern society, with wealth and guns to back them up. We would have neither. But what other leftist movement stands a chance and some kind of victory? I increasingly 
		feel and think that none of them do. Is it better to fight the good fight despite the foreknowledge of probable failure? Maybe. But I have personal goals too. I want to continue to write and read.
		I want to make works of art and new people of my blood. I want to build machine learning tools that can help people, in a way I believe has much more potential despite the capitalistic nature of
		the work. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There is so much more to say on this topic (and I probably will one day) but I'm getting tired and I still have more people I need to discuss this decision with but I'll leave you with some 
		song lyrics I'm listening too.
