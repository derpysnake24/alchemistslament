        <h1> Wilkommen: </h1>
    	  <p>
          	I finished part 1 of Deleuze's Spinoza: Expressionism in Philosophy yesterday. The following will be my understanding of the introduction
		  and section 1, and some of my own thoughts I have on it.
    	  </p>
	  <p>
          	The intro focuses on explaining the importance of expression for Spinza and Deleuze, one of which is the difficulty in relating infinite substance
		  to finite modes, which is one the central difficulties I and many others have with Spinoza.  
    	  </p>
	  <p>
		The title of section 1 is "The Triads of Substance", by which he means substance attribute and essence. Noun(s), verbs, adjectives from a certain
		  point of view.
    	  </p>
	  <p>
          	I need to add a date for these, but in a fancy way. Not just a subtitle at the beginning of each piece. 
    	  </p>
