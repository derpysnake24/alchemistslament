        <h1> Wilkommen: </h1>
    	  <p>
          	I finished part 1 of Deleuze's Spinoza: Expressionism in Philosophy yesterday. The following will be my understanding of the introduction
		  and section 1, and some of my own thoughts on it.
    	  </p>
	  <p>
          	The intro focuses on explaining the importance of expression for Spinza and Deleuze, one of which is the difficulty in relating infinite substance
		  to finite modes, which is one the central difficulties I and many others I have read have with Spinoza. How exactly Deleuze resolves this, if at all, will be 
		  expanded upon later, but expressionism is central to it. Expression itself isn't clearly defined, but he gives numerous examples of what constitutes expression, knowledge itslef being on the
		  most important ones. God is expressed in all our knowledge and ideas. Important to note here is that knowledge is not merely consumption of information,
		  but accurate, practical use of that information to "closer align" with God's "will". This is what makes an idea true for deluze: an expression of God.
		  Complex and diffiucult to ever fully grasp (if at all), but true nonetheless. Ideas come first through God, and then are expressed as objects through us,
		  .... Expression is a genealogical relation from God to us, from substance to attributes. 
		  Another theme in the introduction is that the sum is greater than the whole of its parts. This is expressed directly in the defintions of substance and such,
		  but also in how Spinoza defines substance. He brings together independently deduced definitions and brings them together to form a true idea. This allows 
		  substance to contain an infinitude more than what merely defines it, because it is a two-way street: substance is both defined by and defines it's attributes
		  and modes, and vice versa. It creates an almost labyrinthian, rhizomatic theory of everything. "Expressionism embeds deduction in the absolute".
    	  </p>
	  <p>
		The title of section 1 is "The Triads of Substance", by which he means substance, attribute, and essence. Noun(s), verbs, adjectives from a certain
		  point of view.

          	I need to add a date for these, but in a fancy way. Not just a subtitle at the beginning of each piece.
