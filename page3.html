        <h1> Wilkommen: </h1>

          Love is important. I would even argue (as many have before me) it's the only important thing, the only real thing to create, the only worthwile part of yourself to put out into the world.
          But putting these thoughts into action can be difficult. Loving is naturally easy and incredibly difficult. But the first step on the path of putting love into the world is to turn inward and
          learn how to love yourself.

          I did at one point. Certainly as a child. Up until covid (classic) I really had a strong sense that I was at least on the correct path in life. I knowing the path gives one a certain sense
          of confidence and forgiveness for oneself that could be eqauated to love. I have not felt either of those for a long time. I geuinely have no sense of direction or willingness to let it go when I
          seemingly take a wrong turn. And the latter point is by far the more important. Every decision I make is probably wrong in some way or another, especially at this point in my life, but I need
          to be able to tell myself its ok when that happens. Being to hard on myslef will only make myself feel worse. Other people feel the same way. When one of my friends makes a serious mistake, I
          like to think I forgave them in the past. Nowadays I've noticed myself being harder and exceedingly critical of others, and this may be a reflection of how I treat myself.

          To show my love for other people I often just do them a favor. But this often comes only after I have been given something first. Clean their apartment after I get to sleep over. Carry the ball bag
          because they taught me a rugby move. Spend time with them if they spend time with me, open up to them if they open up to me. It's never really out of just love. Love always seems to come with strings attached. They have to start to love me if I am going to start loving them. Maybe not
          real love but it is a start. So I would need to show myself love before I can love myself? Something like that. I need to spend more time with, not by, myself. Do things for myself that I know I would 
          appreciate. Working out is an interesting example for me personally. The concept was instilled in me from a young age by both my parents. Society praises it, which is one of the few good things that modern
          late stage bourgeoisie capitalsit society does praise. Science praises it for its chemical benefits on the brain and mood. It feels good to do it. But none of that really seems to motivate me anymore.
          Why exactly is another story I havn't quite comprehended yet, but if love truly conquers all, it should motivate me in some respect to get it done. I work out not to feel good, but because I want myself 
          to feel good. Because I love myself, and I want what's best for myself.

          The person I love most in the world is my sister. I would do damn, near anything for her, including take a bullet, which I say I would for a lot of people but don't often mean it upon further reflection.
          I am 100% positive I would take a bullet for my sister. I need to take a bullet for myself. Going to gym when I dont want to. Meditate even though its boring. Shit like that. Not for self-improvement, 
          just because I love myself. And because I know it will make myself better. I've read about creating this differentiation in the mind between something "I" and "me" can be deterimental, but I think it 
          makes sense in this context. At least in theory. Hopefully in practice as well.
