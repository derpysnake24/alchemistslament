        <h1> Wilkommen: </h1>
    	  <p>
          	Recently I've been thinking about the paradoxical nature of reality, or at least reality in the way human beings can understand it. I haven't quite fully developed or expressed this idea yet, 
		  so this will be an exercise in just dumping all my thoughts regarding the matter on the screen and seeing where that takes me.

		Herbert Marcuse's One Dimensional Man takes a hard stance against the practice of modern science and analytic philosophy (most notably Wittgenstein), arguing that they box human thought into a 
		  corner and make diffiuclt, if not impossible, to think outside of the box that is society. I too have had my own doubts about the viablity of science to drag us into some glorious post-capitalist
		  future. Just because an idea or experience is unfalsifiable does not make it untrue. Science and logic's dogmatic view of their methods are knowingly limited, and while they can guide us to 
		  certain advancements and progress, progress is not always a good thing.

		  Paradox is the apparent antidote to science and logic. Whether Zeno or Schr√∂dinger, paradoxes challenge the existing notions of logic and can make very established thinkers seem foolish and
		  arrogant, often dismissing such though experiments as silly and unrealistic. But they also express themselves in the real world through scientific experiments, such as with the double-slit test. 
		  While this may be an issue more with the terminology of particles and waves than with the actual properties that define light as a scientific concept, it still illustrates how in trying to
		  define something scientifically we can very easily to express the true nature of reality. I don't want to get into the philosophy of language (or just semantics as I prefer to call the field),
		  but the point is science is a liar sometimes.
